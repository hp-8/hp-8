I'm a Full-Stack Developer with a focus on creating engaging web experiences. I'm proficient in ReactJS for the frontend and adept at server-side development. I'm passionate about translating ideas into digital solutions.

My work involves crafting intricate user interfaces that captivate users while also delving into the backend to build robust functionality by connecting APIs and databases. I'm dedicated to my craft, often fueled by a cup of ☕ and driven by the flow of code from my fingertips.

I also have a keen interest in AI/ML and it's application in HCI. I have a specific interest in HCI, especially towards building Ambient Intelligence.
